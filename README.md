# Restaurant_Rating_Prediction
Zomato, the online food app, has reached out to you to help them to predict how good or bad a restaurant will turn out in the future.
So that, they can take a decision to include the restaurant in their app or remove it. 
They have shared the data of 9551 restaurants from all over the world which are currently present in the Zomato App.
It contains the details about the restaurants and what rating it achieved finally.  
Our task is to create a machine learning model which can predict the Rating of a restaurant based on its characteristics.
